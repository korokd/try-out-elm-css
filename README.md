I started this mainly because I wanted to try out [elm-css](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css/tree/master).

I didn't like it. Styles are not highly sensible like data, so I couldn't see much value from it besides not having to (or being able to?) set up a {pre,post}-processor. All the while writing it was a lot more clunky (clunkier than styled-components, for example).

If I was to actually develop this, it would be the website for my WoW guild, but I don't think I will.
